JaCoP properties that can be controlled by option -D in java command. For example, java -Dmax_edge_find_size=200 controls the maximal size of the task list in the cumulative constraint to use edge-finding algorithm.


Properties:

Java specific:
==============
- max_edge_find_size: use edge finder in the cumulative constraints if
  it contains less tasks than this number; default 100.


flatzinc compiler specific:
===========================
- fz_cumulative_use_unary: during constraints generation in flatzinc
 compiler use CumulativeUnary for tasks that have resource capacity
 greater than half of the cumulative capacity bound; default=false

- fz_cumulative_use_disjunctions: during constraints generation in
 flatzinc compiler pairwaise task disjunction constraints for all
 pairs of tasks that have sum of resource capacities greater than the
 cumulative capacity bound; default=false
